# Google Analytics Setup Guide for Next.js Applications

## Current Implementation

This project already has Google Analytics 4 (GA4) implemented using Next.js best practices. The implementation consists of:

1. **Environment Variable**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-SSCP8MNF5L` in the `.env` file

2. **Global Script in `_app.js`**: Using Next.js's `Script` component for proper loading

3. **Helper Functions in `lib/gtag.js`**: For tracking pageviews and events

## How Google Analytics is Currently Loaded

In `_app.js`, we load Google Analytics using Next.js's recommended approach:

```javascript
// Global Site Tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics
{gtag.GA_TRACKING_ID && (
  <>
    <Script
      strategy="afterInteractive"
      src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${gtag.GA_TRACKING_ID}`}
      onLoad={() => console.log('GA script loaded')}
    />
    <Script
      id="gtag-init"
      strategy="afterInteractive"
      onLoad={() => {
        console.log('GA initialized');
      }}
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        __html: `
          window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
          function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
          gtag('js', new Date());
          
          gtag('config', '${gtag.GA_TRACKING_ID}', {
            page_location: window.location.href,
            page_title: document.title,
            send_page_view: true,
            debug_mode: ${process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'}
          });
        `,
      }}
    />
  </>
)}
```

## Alternative: Manual Script Placement

If you prefer to manually add the Google Analytics script to each page instead of using the Next.js approach, you can add the following code to the `<head>` section of each page:

```html
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) --> 
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-SSCP8MNF5L"></script> 
<script> 
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; 
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} 
  gtag('js', new Date()); 
 
  gtag('config', 'G-SSCP8MNF5L'); 
</script>
```

However, this approach is **not recommended** for Next.js applications because:

1. It duplicates the script across pages
2. It doesn't leverage Next.js's script optimization
3. It may cause issues with hydration
4. It doesn't respect the environment variable configuration

## Recommended Approach

The current implementation using Next.js's `Script` component in `_app.js` is the recommended approach because:

1. It loads the script only once for the entire application
2. It uses the proper loading strategy (`afterInteractive`)
3. It respects the environment variable configuration
4. It includes debug information in development mode
5. It automatically tracks page views on route changes

## Troubleshooting

If Google Analytics is not working properly:

1. Check that the tracking ID in `.env` is correct: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-SSCP8MNF5L`
2. Verify that the script is loading in the browser (check Network tab)
3. Look for any errors in the browser console
4. Use the GA Debugger components included in this project
5. Install the [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna) Chrome extension

## Testing Google Analytics

This project includes several components for testing Google Analytics:

1. `GADebugger.js`: Shows GA status and sends test events
2. `GATest.js`: Another test component with different event types
3. `GAEventTester.js`: A comprehensive event testing interface
4. `GADirectTest.js`: A direct script implementation for comparison

These components are included on the homepage for easy testing.

## Viewing Events in Google Analytics

To see the events in Google Analytics:

1. Go to the [Google Analytics Dashboard](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Navigate to Reports > Realtime
3. You should see your events appearing in real-time

Note that there may be a delay of a few minutes before events appear in the dashboard.
